I'm excited to share **Mya View** - a personal health companion that puts privacy first.

**The Problem:**

Healthcare is overwhelming. Between juggling doctor appointments, medications, and medical history for multiple family members, it's easy to forget critical details. Most health apps either charge subscription fees, sell your data to advertisers, or require uploading sensitive information to the cloud.

**The Solution:**

Mya View is an open-source health companion that runs 100% locally on your device. Your health data never leaves your computer. No cloud services. No data collection. No subscriptions.

**Key Features:**

🤖 **Local AI Processing** - Powered by Ollama. I literally cannot access your data because it never reaches my servers.

💬 **Natural Conversations** - Ask questions about symptoms, medications, and health history.

📸 **Document Analysis** - Upload or capture photos of prescriptions and lab results.

🔍 **GraphRAG Search** - Semantic search across your medical history using graph relationships.

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Family Profiles** - Track health info for multiple family members with privacy controls.

🎤 **Voice Assistant** - Hands-free interaction perfect for appointments.

📥 **CCD Import** - Import records from MyChart, Epic, and other providers.

**Why Open Source & Free Forever?**

Healthcare data is deeply personal. The entire codebase is public on GitHub under Apache 2.0. You can audit every line, modify it, or contribute improvements.

Healthcare is expensive enough. I'm not interested in extracting value from people's health data or charging subscriptions for basic privacy rights.

**Tech Stack:**

Ollama (local LLM), FastAPI, Neo4j graph database, PostgreSQL + pgvector, Docker. Everything runs locally. Setup takes ~10 minutes.

**What's Next:**

Working on medication interaction detection, timeline visualization, multi-language support, and enhanced document parsing.

**Try It:**

If you believe healthcare tech should respect privacy and empower patients rather than monetize their data, I'd love your feedback, contributions, or a share to help others discover this tool.
